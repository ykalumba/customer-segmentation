# Customer Segmentation
I am working with data from Kaggle. The data contains over 53,000 entries with 20 columns and it is ideal for analyzing customer behavior. The main objective of this project is to perform clustering to segment customers into distinct groups enahnce business prospects that could yield profits to shareholders in a given business industry.
